\description{
A quadratic matrix containing effective distances between wards. Effective distances have been
calculated from \code{\link{igraph}} object \code{\link{units_igraph}} using function \code{\link{graph2effdist}}, which depends on package \code{\link{NetOrigin}}.
Ward names (column and row ids) have been remapped to fake names to prevent their identification.
